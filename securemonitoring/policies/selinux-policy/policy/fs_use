# Define the labeling behavior for inodes in particular filesystem types.
# This information was formerly hardcoded in the SELinux module.

# Use persistent label mappings for the following filesystem types.
# This is appropriate for filesystems with unique and persistent 
# inode numbers.  Be sure to apply setfiles to each filesystem (typically 
# via make relabel) to initialize the mapping.

# Use the allocating task SID to label inodes in the following filesystem
# types, and label the filesystem itself with the specified context.
# This is appropriate for pseudo filesystems that represent objects
# like pipes and sockets, so that these objects are labeled with the same
# type as the creating task.  
fs_use_task pipefs system_u:object_r:fs_t;
fs_use_task sockfs system_u:object_r:fs_t;

# Use a transition SID based on the allocating task SID and the
# filesystem SID to label inodes in the following filesystem types,
# and label the filesystem itself with the specified context.
# This is appropriate for pseudo filesystems like devpts and tmpfs
# where we want to label objects with a derived type.
fs_use_trans devpts system_u:object_r:devpts_t;
fs_use_trans tmpfs system_u:object_r:tmpfs_t;
fs_use_trans shm system_u:object_r:tmpfs_t;

# The separate genfs_contexts configuration can be used for filesystem 
# types that cannot support persistent label mappings or use
# one of the fixed label schemes specified here.
