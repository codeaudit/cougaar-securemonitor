# User configuration.
#
# This file defines each user recognized by the system security policy.
# Only the user identities defined in this file may be used as the
# user attribute in a security context.
#
# Each user has a set of roles that may be entered by processes
# with the users identity.  The syntax of a user declaration is:
#
# 	user username roles role_set [ ranges MLS_range_set ];
#
# The MLS range set should only be specified if MLS was enabled
# for the module and checkpolicy.

#
# system_u is the user identity for system processes and objects.
# There should be no corresponding Unix user identity for system_u,
# and a user process should never be assigned the system_u user
# identity.
#
user system_u roles system_r;

#
# user_u is a generic user identity for Linux users who have no
# SELinux user identity defined.  The modified daemons will use
# this user identity in the security context if there is no matching
# SELinux user identity for a Linux user.  If you do not want to
# permit any access to such users, then remove this entry.
#
user user_u roles user_r;


#
# The following users correspond to Unix identities.
# These identities are typically assigned as the user attribute
# when login starts the user shell.
